# Stoic Dreams Web Complete
## From [Stoic Dreams](https://www.stoicdreams.com/home)

This .NET Framework library combines all of our .NET libraries into a single framework.

This framework is in very early development, with features expected to change frequently.

# Getting Startet - Nuget

This project will be available for projects via a Nuget package. I will update this when it is live.

We are also rebuilding our website [HatchMyWeb.com](https://www.hatchmyweb.com) to host tutorials and code samples to help anyone interested in using this framework or any of our other libraries.


### Prerequisites

This library was created as a .NET Standard library using Visual Studio 2019. To my knowledge you should be able to use this in any modern .NET Framework, .NET Core, or .NET Standard project.

Please contact me if you get any errors installing or using this project's associated Nuget package in any .NET project.
