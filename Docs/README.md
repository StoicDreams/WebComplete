# [Stoic Dreams](https://www.stoicdreams.com/home)' Web Complete

## About

This .NET Framework library combines all of our .NET libraries into a single framework.

This framework is in very early development, with features expected to change frequently.

## Getting Startet - [Nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WebComplete)

This framework is available for projects via its [Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/StoicDreamsWebServer).

This framework should be compatible with any .NET Core 3.0 or .NET Standard 2.1 project. But it is being specifically designed to be used in Blazor projects.

For Blazor projects, install [Stoic Dreams Web Server](https://www.nuget.org/packages/StoicDreamsWebServer) in your Blazor Server project. Then install [Stoic Dreams Web Shared](https://www.nuget.org/packages/StoicDreamsWebShared) in your Blazor Shared project.

We are also rebuilding our website [HatchMyWeb.com](https://www.hatchmyweb.com) to host tutorials and code samples to help anyone interested in using this framework or any of our other libraries.

## Prerequisites

Minimum .NET Core 3.0 or .NET Standard 2.1 projects.
